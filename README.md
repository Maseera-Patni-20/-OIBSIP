# Internship Projects at Oasis Infobyte

This repository showcases the projects I completed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. It contains three main projects, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis and machine learning.

## Projects Included:

### 1. Iris Dataset Classification

**Description:** This project involves the classification of the Iris dataset using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to accurately predict the species of iris flowers based on their features.  
**Techniques Used:** Data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.  
**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib.  
**Note:** The Iris dataset can be downloaded from the `sklearn.datasets` library in Python.

2. Unemployment Analysis
Description: In this project, I analyzed unemployment data from a specific dataset. The objective was to uncover trends and patterns in the unemployment rate, employment estimates, and labor participation rate.
Techniques Used: Data cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization, and interpretation of results.
Tools: Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.

3. Sales Analysis
Description: This project focuses on analyzing sales data to provide insights into sales performance, trends, and patterns. The analysis helps in understanding the factors influencing sales and identifying opportunities for improvement.
Techniques Used: Data aggregation, time series analysis, data visualization, and reporting.
Tools: Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.

**Code Snippet to Load Iris Dataset:**
```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
import pandas as pd

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()

# Create a DataFrame with feature names and target
iris_df = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
iris_df['Species'] = iris.target
