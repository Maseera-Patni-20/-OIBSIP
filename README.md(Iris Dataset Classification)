# Iris Dataset Classification

This project involves the classification of the Iris dataset using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to accurately predict the species of iris flowers based on their features.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset used for classification tasks in machine learning. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is divided into three classes, each representing a different species of iris.

## Project Details

### Libraries Used
- `sklearn`: For machine learning algorithms and dataset handling
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `seaborn`: For data visualization
- `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs

### Steps Followed
1. **Loading the Dataset:** The Iris dataset is loaded from the `sklearn.datasets` module.
2. **Data Preparation:** A DataFrame is created with feature names and target labels.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
    - Displaying the DataFrame
    - Statistical summary of the data
    - Checking for missing values
    - Computing the correlation matrix
4. **Data Splitting:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
5. **Model Training:** A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training set.
6. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Accuracy calculation
    - Confusion matrix and classification report
    - Visualization of the confusion matrix using a heatmap

### Loading the Dataset

The Iris dataset can be loaded directly from the `sklearn.datasets` module as shown below:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()

# Create a DataFrame with feature names and target
iris_df = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
iris_df['Species'] = iris.target
Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy score on the test set. The confusion matrix and classification report provide detailed insights into the model's performance.
